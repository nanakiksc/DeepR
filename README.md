# DeepR
Deep Learning Framework for R

DeepR (pronounced deeper) is a framework to build feedforward neural networks in R.
The idea that started the project was to incorporate network topology (width and depth)
as part of the hyperparameters, so it could be easily optimized by cross-validation.
Since then, and following the same philosophy, one can change things such as
activation and cost funcions, batch sizes, weight initialization methods, dropout, etc.
with just the change of an argument.
Basically, one can build a deep neural network with a single line of code (and train it with one more line).

Documentation coming soon.
